# Welcome to the Programming Logic study repository
Programming logic is the foundation of software development. It involves understanding problems, breaking them down into smaller steps and organizing these steps systematically to create solutions. This skill is essential for anyone interested in programming, regardless of the specific language or technology.

This repository aims to share some of my studies of programming logic using Python. The content is available on this project's Wiki for better organization:

1. [Introduction to Programming Logic - Link for Original PT-Version](https://github.com/alinealien/estudos-logica-com-python/wiki/1.-L%C3%B3gica-de-Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o)
2. [Data Structure - Link for Original PT-Version](https://github.com/alinealien/estudos-logica-com-python/wiki/2.-Estrutura-de-Dados)
3. [Object Oriented Programming - Link for Original PT-Version](https://github.com/alinealien/estudos-logica-com-python/wiki/3.-Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Orientada-a-Objetos)

Oh, there are also several algorithms for studying Python in practice! I hope the content helps you in your journey and studies ;-)
